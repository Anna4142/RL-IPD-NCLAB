# RL-IPD-NCLAB

## Introduction

**RL-IPD-NCLAB** is a research project focusing on the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) within a network computing laboratory environment. This project aims to explore the dynamics of cooperative and competitive behaviors in agent-based models, utilizing the principles of RL to adapt and evolve strategies over time.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key components:

- **Buffer**: Contains the implementation of the replay buffer used in reinforcement learning algorithms.
- **Evaluation**: Scripts and tools for evaluating the performance and strategy effectiveness of RL agents.
- **Agents**: The directory hosts various RL agent implementations that compete or cooperate in the IPD.
- **Envs**: Custom environments for the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, tailored for reinforcement learning experiments.
- **main.py**: The main script to kick off training sessions or experiments.
